# CSE 446 (Machine Learning) - 2022 Spring

**Instructor:** Kevin Jamieson and Ludwig Schmidt

**Course info:** Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from historical data and make inferences about future outcomes. This study is a marriage of algorithms, computation, and statistics so this class will be have healthy doses of each. The goals of this course are to provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental methodologies and algorithms of machine learning.
